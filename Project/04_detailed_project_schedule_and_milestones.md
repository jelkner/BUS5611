*   **Activities:** Develop responsive UI components using Next.js (React) based on the signed-off mockups and style guide. Implement client-side logic for user interactions, product browsing, shopping cart management, and the multi-step checkout process. Integrate frontend components with the backend APIs developed in Phase 2. Implement robust multi-language support using i18n libraries, ensuring seamless language switching and content display for English, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish. Critically, embed WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards throughout the development process, including semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility for all components and user flows.
*   **Deliverables:** Fully developed and responsive frontend application for key user journeys (homepage, product listing, product detail, cart, checkout, user account pages). Implemented multi-language switching capability. Frontend components meet accessibility guidelines.
*   **Milestone:** Key user flows are implemented on the frontend, successfully communicating with backend APIs. Basic language switching is functional. Core accessibility features are integrated and demonstrable.

**Phase 4: Integrations, Content Population, and Translation Management (Duration: 3 weeks - Potential for 1-week overlap with late Frontend Development)**

This phase focuses on connecting all remaining third-party services, populating the platform with actual product data and content, and managing the translation workflow.
*   **Activities:** Finalize and thoroughly test all payment gateway integrations for North America, China, and Latin America. Integrate shipping logic (real-time calculation or table-based rates). Set up analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, with considerations for China). Populate the database with the company’s product catalog, including descriptions, images, and pricing. Manage the translation process for all UI text, product information, and static content pages (e.g., About Us, FAQs, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) into Simplified Chinese and Spanish, ensuring quality and cultural appropriateness. Upload and link all translated content within the CMS and platform.
*   **Deliverables:** Fully integrated and tested payment gateways for all target regions. Functional shipping calculation. Analytics tracking implemented. The platform populated with initial product data and essential content in all three languages (English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish).
