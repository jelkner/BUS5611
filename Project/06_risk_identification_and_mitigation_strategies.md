## 6. Risk Identification and Mitigation Strategies

This section identifies potential risks that could impact the successful delivery of the multi-language e-commerce platform. For each risk, an assessment of its likelihood and potential impact is provided, along with proactive mitigation strategies to reduce its probability or effect, and contingency plans to address the risk should it materialize. This proactive approach to risk management is crucial for a project with an aggressive timeline, a tight budget, and the complexities of entering new international markets.

**Risk Categories:** Technical, Market-Entry, Budget Overruns, Timeline Delays, Resource Constraints, Scope Creep, and External Dependencies.

--- 

**1. Risk: Scope Creep**
*   **Description:** Uncontrolled changes or continuous addition of new features beyond the agreed-upon MVP scope, leading to timeline delays and budget overruns.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Common in software projects, especially with enthusiastic stakeholders).
*   **Impact:** High (Can derail project schedule and budget, reduce quality if rushed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a clearly defined and formally signed-off MVP scope (as detailed in Section 1 and reinforced by budget constraints in Section 5).
    *   Implement a formal change request process: all new feature requests must be documented, evaluated for impact on timeline/budget/resources, and approved by key stakeholders before implementation.
    *   Maintain a feature backlog for post-MVP enhancements, acknowledging good ideas but deferring them to future phases.
    *   Regular communication with stakeholders to manage expectations and reinforce scope boundaries.
*   **Contingency Plan:**
    *   If minor scope changes are approved, utilize the contingency budget and assess if any existing lower-priority MVP features can be deferred to accommodate.
    *   For significant scope changes, negotiate a revised timeline and budget, or a phased rollout where the new scope is part of a subsequent project phase.
